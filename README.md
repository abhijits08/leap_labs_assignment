# leap_labs_assignment

This coding assignment was done on Google Colab as a Jupyter Notebook so that there are no compatibility issues. To reproduce the results in this notebook, it needs to be uploaded on google drive along with the folder “test_data”. The filepath variable also needs to be modified suitably (wherever the “test_data” folder is stored).

To run it outside Google Colab, simply comment out the first two lines of code (first code block of the notebook) and change the filepath variable to wherever the “test_data” folder is stored.

To test on multiple images, you can use the “additional_test_data” folder.
